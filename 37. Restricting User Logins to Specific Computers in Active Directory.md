# 🔐 Restricting User Logins to Specific Computers in Active Directory

## 🏢 Example Environment Used in This Guide

To make this easier to understand, let’s assume the following Active Directory setup:

* **Active Directory Domain:** `adserver.local`
* **Organizational Unit (OU):** `Domain_Users`
* **User Account:** `xitiz.basnet`

This guide explains how to restrict the user **xitiz.basnet** so they can log in **only to specific computers** in the domain.

---

## 🔐 What Does “Restrict Log On To Specific Computers” Mean?

By default:

➡️ A domain user can log on to **any computer** joined to `adserver.local`.

However, this is not always secure.

Active Directory allows administrators to:

✅ Allow a user to log in **only on approved computers**

❌ Block the user from logging in on all other machines

This helps prevent:

* Unauthorized access
* Credential misuse
* Logging in from unapproved devices

---

## 🛠 Where Is This Setting Located?

The setting is configured using:

📍 **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**

📍 Inside the **user account properties**

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Guide (Beginner Friendly)

### 🧩 Step 1: Open Active Directory Users and Computers

1. Log in to the **Domain Controller** for `adserver.local`
2. Click **Start**
3. Search for **Active Directory Users and Computers**
4. Open the console

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Locate the User Account

1. In ADUC, navigate to the OU named **Domain_Users**
2. Find the user account **xitiz.basnet**
3. **Double-click** the user to open properties

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Open the Account Tab

1. In the user properties window
2. Click the **Account** tab
3. Click the **Log On To…** button

👉 This setting controls **which computers xitiz.basnet is allowed to log into**

---

### 🧩 Step 4: Configure Allowed Computers

1. Click **Log On To…**
2. Select **The following computers**
3. Enter the computer hostname

   **Example:**

   ```
   PC02
   ```
4. Click **Add**
5. Click **OK**
6. Click **Apply**

✅ The user **xitiz.basnet** can now log in **only to PC02**

---

## 🚫 What Happens If the User Logs in Elsewhere?

If **xitiz.basnet** tries to log in from another computer, such as `PC01`:

❌ Windows blocks the login

❌ The following error message is displayed:

> *Your account is configured to prevent you from using this PC*

This happens because:

* `PC01` is **not listed** as an allowed workstation
* Only `PC02` is permitted

---

## ➕ Allowing Access to Multiple Computers

If **xitiz.basnet** needs access to more than one computer, simply add them:

**Example allowed computers:**

* `PC01`
* `PC02`
* `LAPTOP05`

---

## ⚙️ Behind the Scenes (Simple Explanation)

Active Directory stores this configuration in the **`Attribute Editor`** of the user account.

🧩 Attribute name: **`userWorkstations`**

Key details:

* Contains a **comma-separated list** of computer names
* Example value:

  ```
  PC01,PC02,LAPTOP05
  ```
* Can be managed using:

  * PowerShell
  * Attribute Editor
  * Automation tools

⚠️ For beginners, using the **ADUC graphical interface** is strongly recommended.
