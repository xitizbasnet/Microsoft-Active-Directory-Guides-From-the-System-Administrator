# 📘 Enabling Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar Using Group Policy

## 📌 Document Purpose

This document provides step-by-step instructions for enabling the **Bookmarks Toolbar** in **Mozilla Firefox** using **Group Policy Objects (GPO)** in a **Windows Server Active Directory environment**.

The configuration is applied at the **computer level** and leverages **Mozilla Firefox Administrative Templates (ADMX)**, which are maintained in the associated GitHub repository.

---

## 🧩 Scope

This guide applies to:

* Domain-joined Windows computers
* Centralized Firefox configuration via Group Policy
* Environments using Windows Server (2016+ recommended)

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following requirements are met:

* 🖥️ Windows Server with **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** installed
* 🌐 Active Directory domain environment
* 🦊 Mozilla Firefox installed on target machines
* 📄 Firefox **ADMX/ADML policy templates** correctly installed
* 🧑‍💼 Administrative privileges in the domain

---

## 🏗️ Step 1: Create a Group Policy Object

1. Open **Group Policy Management**

   * Navigate to:
     **Server Manager → Tools → Group Policy Management**

2. Create a new GPO

   * Right-click **Group Policy Objects**
   * Select **New**
   * Name the policy:
     **Firefox – Browser Settings**
   * Click **OK**

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Edit the Group Policy Object

1. Right-click the newly created GPO
2. Select **Edit**

---

## 🦊 Step 3: Configure Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar Policy

### 📍 Policy Path

```
Computer Configuration
└── Policies
    └── Administrative Templates
        └── Mozilla
            └── Firefox
```

### 🔧 Policy Configuration

* Locate the policy:
  **Display Bookmarks Toolbar**
* Set the policy to:
  ✅ **Enabled**
* Under **Options**, select:
  📌 **Always**
* Click **Apply**, then **OK**

📖 **Description:**
This setting forces the Firefox bookmarks toolbar to remain visible for all users on the targeted computers.

---

## 🚫 Step 4: Disable User Configuration (Best Practice)

Since this policy only contains **computer-based settings**, disable user settings to optimize processing:

1. Select the GPO
2. Open the **Details** tab
3. Set **GPO Status** to:
   **User Configuration Settings Disabled**

---

## 🗂️ Step 5: Link the GPO to an Organizational Unit (OU)

1. Identify the OU containing the target computers
2. Drag and drop the **Firefox – Browser Settings** GPO onto the OU
3. Confirm the link when prompted

📌 The policy will now apply to all computers within this OU.

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test the Policy on a Client Machine

### 🔍 Initial Check

* Open **Mozilla Firefox**
* Verify that the **Bookmarks Toolbar** is **not yet visible**

### 🔄 Force Group Policy Update

1. Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator
2. Run:

   ```
   gpupdate
   ```
3. Wait for the policy update to complete successfully

### 🔁 Restart Firefox

* Close Firefox completely
* Reopen Firefox

### ✅ Verification

* Confirm that the **Bookmarks Toolbar** is now enabled and visible

---

## ✔️ Expected Result

The Firefox bookmarks toolbar is permanently displayed and enforced by Group Policy on all targeted domain computers.

---

## 📎 Notes & Best Practices

* 🔁 Firefox must be restarted for browser policies to apply
* 🧠 Computer-based policies apply regardless of the logged-in user
* 📦 Keep Firefox ADMX templates updated as per the GitHub repository
* 🧪 Test policies in a staging OU before production deployment

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Using Group Policy and Firefox administrative templates provides a centralized, consistent, and scalable method to manage Firefox browser settings. Enforcing the bookmarks toolbar ensures a standardized user experience across the enterprise.
